# OGNL-Injection (Object-Graph Navigation Language)

# About OGNL
OGNL is a powerful expression language used in Java applications to get and set properties of Java objects.

OGNL is powerful because it allows:-
          >  Accessing and invoking object properties/methods
          >  Executing Java code dynamically
          >  Creating and modifying objects at runtime

Apache Struts 2, a most popular Java web framework, uses OGNL to bind HTTP request parameters to Java objects in MVC (Model-View-Controller).

# vulnerabilites generated by the mis-use of OGNL
   >  Instantiating arbitrary classes
   >  Reflectively invoking methods
   >  Reading and writing fields
   >  Executing system commands
   >  Including Full RCE

# Common OGNL Injection Sinks in Struts 2
In vulnerable versions of Struts 2:
         >  Input parameters, headers, or URL paths may be automatically evaluated as OGNL.
         >  Interceptors (e.g., ParametersInterceptor, StaticParametersInterceptor) could allow injection.
