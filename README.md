# OGNL-Injection (Object-Graph Navigation Language)

# About OGNL
OGNL is a powerful expression language used in Java applications to get and set properties of Java objects.

OGNL is powerful because it allow:-
1. Accessing and invoking object properties/methods
2. Executing Java code dynamically
3. Creating and modifying objects at runtime

Apache Struts 2, a most popular Java web framework, uses OGNL to bind HTTP request parameters to Java objects in MVC (Model-View-Controller).

# vulnerabilites generated by the mis-use of OGNL
1. Instantiating arbitrary classes
2. Reflectively invoking methods
3. Reading and writing fields
4. Executing system commands
5. Including Full RCE

# Common OGNL Injection Sinks in Struts 2
In vulnerable versions of Struts 2:
1. Input parameters, headers, or URL paths may be automatically evaluated as OGNL.
2. Interceptors (e.g., ParametersInterceptor, StaticParametersInterceptor) could allow injection.
